There are also numerous reports of bridges being destroyed, though the total numbers are yet to be confirmed. The 10 May 2024 flash floods intensified the flooding across the Northeast, and by 17 May, the situation had worsened. The combination and accumulation of these floods have caused severe humanitarian needs. A total of 33 provinces (out of 34 provinces in Afghanistan) have been impacted, with Baghlan and Ghor hardest hit.
